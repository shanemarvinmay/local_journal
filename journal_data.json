I will try to format my entries so that I can derive information from them later.Situation: I am currently attending PVAMU but am off for winter break. I plan to graduate in May 2020 and have confirmed offers at USAA and at Google, however; the Google offer only last for a year.Day:It's only noon so I haven't done much yet. So far I have only check my 'special' facebook messages and went shopping. I went shopping to buy groceries and the new StarWars game. I got the StarWars games because Kay wants me around the house, however; I am extremely board at home. So I thought I'd buy it, play it, then return it in a few days so that I don't loose any money. I am currently talking to Nicole as friends, just to have someone to talk to, however; I will have to end it soon as I am not planning on going to USAA. I think Nicole only talks to me because she thinks I am going to USAA.Side Note:I plan on changing my spanish learning strategy to only do core lessons until I'm really unfamiliar with something. If I am unfamiliar with something and get at least 3 wrong, I will do the supporting/smaller lessons. After completely (or during)  the core lessons, I will then go back and casually go through the supporting lessons.",
